🚦 Quick Start
1. Basic Usage
python
from src.dynamic_difficulty_adjustment import DynamicDifficultyAdjustment
from src.collaborative_filtering import CollaborativeFilter

# Initialize components
dda = DynamicDifficultyAdjustment()
cf = CollaborativeFilter()

# Example: Adjust difficulty based on performance
new_difficulty = dda.update_difficulty(
    error_rate=0.25, 
    response_time=45, 
    engagement_score=0.8
)
print(f"Adjusted difficulty: {new_difficulty:.2f}")
2. Running the API Server
bash
python src/api_integration.py
The API will be available at http://localhost:5000 with endpoints:

POST /api/v1/recommendations - Get personalized learning recommendations

POST /api/v1/progress - Update student progress

GET /api/v1/analytics - Retrieve learning analytics

3. Model Training and Optimization
python
from src.model_optimization import optimize_model

# Load original model
model = load_pretrained_model()

# Apply quantization and pruning
optimized_model = optimize_model(
    model, 
    quantization=True, 
    pruning_rate=0.3
)

# Save optimized model
optimized_model.save('models/optimized_model.h5')
